# **Swizoshare ‚Äì Security & Functional Test Results (Intern 3)**

### üß† Executive Summary

This document presents the results of a **comprehensive security and functional assessment** of the *Swizoshare ‚Äì Secure File Sharing Portal*, developed as part of the Swizosoft warm-up project.
A total of **29 tests** were conducted covering authentication, access control, session management, CSRF protection, file upload validation, database integrity, and configuration hardening.
All critical tests passed successfully, confirming strong adherence to secure coding principles and expected functional behavior.
Minor recommendations include tightening PHP configuration settings, using a least-privileged MySQL user for production, and implementing activity logging for enhanced traceability.

## üßæ Final Summary ‚Äî Swizoshare Security & Functional Verification (Intern 3)

All **29 test cases** were executed successfully on the local development setup (`localhost`, Apache via XAMPP, MySQL port 3307, database: `swizoshare`).
The system passed all **critical security and functional validations**, including authentication, session management, CSRF handling, file uploads, and access control.

### üîí Key Security Highlights

* **Authentication & Sessions:** Secure login with prepared statements, bcrypt hashing, and session regeneration.
* **Input & Output Handling:** Sanitization and escaping prevent XSS and injection risks.
* **File Upload Security:** MIME & extension filters + `.htaccess` protection validated.
* **Access Control & IDOR:** Proper ownership checks and secure token downloads.
* **CSRF Protection:** Every POST request validated using unique CSRF tokens.
* **Database Integrity & Backup:** Successful restore tested via `init_db.sql`; consistent schema and data integrity.
* **Error Handling:** All outputs safe; no stack traces or database info leaked.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Minor Observations

* **Database User:** Root used for testing; production should use a **least-privileged MySQL user**.
* **PHP Configuration:** `expose_php=On`, cookie flags disabled (`HttpOnly`, `Secure`, `SameSite`) ‚Äî acceptable for dev, must be hardened later.
* **Logging:** No audit logs; recommended for upload/download activity tracking.

### ‚úÖ Overall Verdict

> All **29 tests passed**, including all critical security validations.
> The Swizoshare portal demonstrates solid implementation of secure file-sharing functionality with proper defense against common web attacks (SQLi, XSS, CSRF, IDOR).
> Only minor hardening tasks remain for production deployment.
